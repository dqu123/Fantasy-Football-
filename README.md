Fantasy-Football-
=================
This is a personal project by David Qu to
use data from fantasyfootballnerd.com to create
applications that assist in the analysis and
enjoyment of the Fantasy Football game. 

Stage 1:
The initial stage of this project will involve transferring
json data from fantasyfootballnerd.com and developing
an initial database for this data using Python to parse json.
The data may be migrated to a standardized SQL or NoSQL DB
in the future.

Run node src/drafter/index.js for the current version of the drafter.
Currently the application lets any number of drafters select players
in any order.
